# Acing the Interviews
ethical cheats for performing excellently at job interviews and take-home assignments.

<div style={{fontSize: '0.6em'}}>Joris van de Donk, 2020</div>

## Disclaimer!

The goal of this presentation is for you to get better at

_job interviews_ and _take-home assignments_

<Appear>

**in an ethical way**

</Appear>

---

## Disclaimer!

It's all about _exposing the truth about yourself_...

...so that you can find a _suitable assignment_

<Notes>

By applying the tips from this presentation into your interviews, you'll _expose the truth_ 
about yourself and your skills, thereby making it more likely that you're going to find a _suitable_ job / assignment.
That does _not_ mean that you will _get the job_; it means that you will _get the right job_ that's suitable for _you_.

</Notes>

---

## Disclaimer!

These are all my personal thoughts!

based on my own experiences as interviewer and interviewee.

<Notes>

This presentation contains my own personal thoughts on this subject, which are based on both my own personal experience as an interviewer and interviewee, as well as conversations with others.
I have a certain _moral_ regarding how interviews should be conducted, which is somewhat strict and different from how others think about this.

  <li>Assume a different personality</li>
  <li>Present knowledge or skills you don't have</li>

## Three keys to success

Be:

<ul>
<Appear>
<li>Confident</li>
<li>Comfortable</li>
<li>Enjoying it</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

### After an interview, you'll be (implicitly) judged on two qualities:

<Horizontal>

<div style={{paddingRight: "50px"}}>
  <h3>Worthiness</h3>
  <Appear>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you do the job?</li>
      <li>Are you a good cultural fit?</li>
    </ul>
  </Appear>
</div>

<div style={{paddingLeft: "50px"}}>
  <h3>Memorability</h3>
  <Appear>
    <ul>
      <li>Fun</li>
      <li>Unique</li>
      <li>Engaging</li>
    </ul>
  </Appear>
</div>

## Your skills and personality make you more _worthy_

## Personal branding can make you more _memorable_

# Interviews: tips and tricks

</Invert>

---

## The best thing about job interviews is that you can _prepare_ for them

---

## You _will_ be asked:

* To introduce yourself
* What your key skills are
* What your key weaknesses are
* To explain why you left your previous job and/or country
* To explain any gaps in your resumé

---

## Interviewers are searching for:

* Red flags
* Followup questions to what the candidate is saying

---

## The things you say create _hooks_ for followup questions

---

## It is your conversational duty to _provide_ these hooks

---

## The best way is via a _personal_, _unique_ introduction!

---

### Example of a personal introductions

My name is Joris van de Donk.
Rather than just believing that _infrastructure_ should be expressed as code, I believe that _anything_ should be expressed as code.
I consider myself to be an advocate of this practice, and hope to inspire and teach others to create fun, creative, engaging things with code.
Instead of creating presentations in Powerpoint or Google Slides, I prefer to program them myself using the latest web technologies.
This gives me flexibility, and allows me to create some cool things that otherwise wouldn't be easy to achieve.
I once programmed a presentation about making music using code, and made it so that I could use my electric guitar as a slide clicker. It went really well, despite the fact that I don't really know how to play the guitar, and had to ask the audience how to play certain chords!

<Notes>
This is information dense: it elaborates on how:
* I believe in expressing _anything_ as code, not just _infrastructure_.
* I am enthusiastic about making and holding presentations.
* I am opinionated and back opinions with motivations.
* I am creative and code in my spare time.
* Software engineering ain't just a _job_ to me.
* I like teaching and inspiring others to make cool things.
</Notes>

## Tips

* Most interviewers will start off by asking you to introduce yourself, so have a story prepared!
* In some fields (e.g. game development) people love anecdotes.
* Many interviewers see it as their responsibility to make you feel comfortable, since it gives them clearer information about you and allows them to eliminate nervosity as a potential reason for unclear/incorrect answers. If you instead take this responsibility, you allow the interviewers to focus on acquiring the right information from you.
* Conversational and presentational skills are a key skill when it comes to job interviews. A large part of a job interview _is_ presenting, but rather than presenting on some subject, you are presenting _yourself_.
* Come prepared; have questions ready! This shows interest.
* Take notes during your conversation.
* If there is a subsequent interview: figure out what you liked about the company, and mention reasons for why you'd think you'll fit well.

## War stories

A _United States Military_ proverb:

<Appear>

> Those who don’t have war stories, have not been deployed

</Appear>

---

A _Software Engineer_ proverb:

<Appear>

> Those who don’t have war stories, have not <strike>been</strike> deployed

</Appear>

---

### Many engineers love war stories.

Whenever you write software, you're gonna eventually do something wrong. A good war story encapsulates something that went wrong, and what you learned from it. Doing things without learning is not the way we develop software, so we should cherish war stories.

# Take-home assignments

</Invert>

---

These are little projects that ask you to <em>develop a small project</em>, within <em>limited time</em>, so that the interviewees can <em>get an example of the quality of your work</em> and have a <em>reference point to base questions on</em> in a subsequent interview.

---

## Example

<WrittenText>
  <p>Hi Joris,</p>
  <p>As part of our standard interview procedure, we'd like you to complete a short take-home assignment.</p>
  <p>You should spend no more than 4 hours on this!</p>
  <p>Your task is to create a simple online 2-player web-based Chess game engine. You must separate out the back-end from the front-end. In this chess engine, it must not be possible to make illegal moves.</p>
  <p>Good luck!!</p>
</WrittenText>

---

As soon as you receive a take-home assignment, you should:
* Ask questions
* State assumptions
* State when you will be able to work on it

---

<WrittenText>
  <p>Hi Person,</p>
  <p>Would it be okay if I write this in TypeScript?</p>
  <p>I'm going to assume that the reviewer of my project will be working on an environment in which they can run and build Docker containers.</p>
  <p>I will be working on this during the weekend, and hope to send you the finished project before the end of Sunday.</p>
  <p>Regards, Joris</p>
</WrittenText>

---

You should treat these projects like any other project you work on !

---


The first thing you do?

<Appear>
  

  <div>
    <code>
    git init
    </code>
  </div>


</Appear>

---

Then:

<ul>
<Appear>


* Scaffold the project (e.g. `npm init`, `npm install ...`)


* Ensure there's a unit testing framework


* Write a readme containing instructions on how to boot up your project, and on which OS it was developed/tested


</Appear>
</ul>

---

## Next, write the code!

Focus on _readability_, _understandability_

---

## Finally, do a retro & lookahead!

<ul>
  <Appear>
  <li>What went well?</li>
  <li>What went wrong?</li>
  <li>What would you do differently next time?</li>
  <li>What would you add to the project if you <em>had more time</em> or <em>wanted to expand on the project</em>?</li>
  <b>Write all of this up in your readme file!</b>
</Appear>
</ul>

---

## Tips

<ul>
<Appear>
  <li>Even if not asked for, hand in your entire git repo! Mention that you have included the entire repo when handing it in.</li>
  <li>Spend more time on your readme than you'd think you should take</li>
  <li>Follow instructions carefully; if they say you can work a max of 4 hours on it, don't spend more than 4 hours on it!</li>
  <li>Do <em>not</em> ask anyone for help without disclosing it upfront in your readme</li>
  <li>The easier a project is to get running locally, the better it is!</li>
  <li>Docker(compose) is your friend; if it takes you a few minutes to make a dockerfile to get your project running quickly, do so!</li>
</Appear>
</ul>
