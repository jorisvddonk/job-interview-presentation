# Acing the Interviews
ethical cheats for performing excellently at job interviews and take-home assignments.

<div style={{fontSize: '0.6em'}}>Joris van de Donk, 2020</div>

## Disclaimer!

The goal of this presentation is for you to get better at

_job interviews_ and _take-home assignments_

<Appear>

**in an ethical way**

</Appear>

---

## Disclaimer!

It's all about _exposing the truth about yourself_...

...so that you can find a _suitable assignment_

<Notes>

By applying the tips from this presentation into your interviews, you'll _expose the truth_ 
about yourself and your skills, thereby making it more likely that you're going to find a _suitable_ job / assignment.
That does _not_ mean that you will _get the job_; it means that you will _get the right job_ that's suitable for _you_.

</Notes>

## Disclaimer!

These are all my personal thoughts!

based on my own experiences as interviewer and interviewee.

<Notes>

This presentation contains my own personal thoughts on this subject, which are based on both my own personal experience as an interviewer and interviewee, as well as conversations with others.
I have a certain _moral_ regarding how interviews should be conducted, which is somewhat strict and different from how others think about this.

### Example of a personal introductions

My name is Joris van de Donk. Rather than just believing that _infrastructure_ should be expressed as code, I believe that _anything_ should be expressed as code. I consider myself to be an advocate of this practice, and hope to inspire others to create fun, creative, engaging things with code. For example, instead of creating presentations in Powerpoint or Google Slides, I prefer to program them myself. This gives me flexibility, and allows me to create some cool things that otherwise wouldn't be easy to achieve. As an example, I once programmed a presentation about making music using code, and made it so that I could use my electric guitar as a slide clicker. It went really well, despite the fact that I don't really know how to play the guitar, and had to ask the audience how to play certain chords!

<Notes>
This is information dense: it elaborates on how:
* I believe in expressing _anything_ as code, not just _infrastructure_.
* I am enthusiastic about making and holding presentations.
* I am opinionated and back opinions with motivations.
* I am creative and code in my spare time.
* Software engineering ain't just a _job_ to me.
* I like teaching and inspiring others to make cool things.

## Tips

* Most interviewers will start off by asking you to introduce yourself, so have a story prepared!
* In some fields (e.g. game development) people love anecdotes.
* Many interviewers see it as their responsibility to make you feel comfortable, since it gives them clearer information about you and allows them to eliminate nervosity as a potential reason for unclear/incorrect answers. If you instead take this responsibility, you allow the interviewers to focus on acquiring the right information from you.
* Conversational and presentational skills are a key skill when it comes to job interviews. A large part of a job interview _is_ presenting, but rather than presenting on some subject, you are presenting _yourself_.

## Tips

<ul>
<Appear>
  <li>Treat this like any other short time-limited project!</li>
  <li>Start with `git init`</li>
  <li>Then scaffold the project</li>
  <li>Even if not asked for, hand in your entire git repo! Mention that you have incliuded the entire repo when handing it in.</li>
  <li>Spend more time on your readme than you'd think you should take</li>
  <li>Follow instructions carefully; if they say you can work a max of 4 hours on it, don't spend more than 4 hours on it!</li>
  <li>Do _not_ ask anyone for help without disclosing it upfront in your readme</li>
  <li>Docker(compose) is your friend; if it takes you a few minutes to make a dockerfile to get your project running quickly, do so!</li>
  <li></li>
  <li></li>
  <li>Ask questions! Do not assume anything</li>
  <li>Write a "future plans" section where you indicate what you'd have done if you had more time, or how the project can be expanded!</li>
  <li>Write a "reflections" section where you reflect upon your own work and indicate what went well, what didn't, and how you'd approach things differently in the future.</li>
</Appear>
</ul>
