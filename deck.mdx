# Acing the Interviews
ethical cheats for performing excellently at job interviews and take-home assignments.

<div style={{fontSize: '0.6em'}}>Joris van de Donk, 2020</div>

## Disclaimer!

<Appear>

Everything in this presentation is _my own opinion_ <br/> based on _my own experiences_ as an interviewer and interviewee.

</Appear>

---

## Disclaimer!

Don't copy; think rationally.<br/> This works for me, maybe not for you.

---

## What you'll (hopefully) learn

Not skills to get <em>any</em> job/assignment, <br/> instead: tips to get jobs/assignments that <em>fit</em>.

<Notes>

By applying the tips from this presentation into your interviews, you'll _expose the truth_ 
about yourself and your skills, thereby making it more likely that you're going to find a _suitable_ job / assignment.
That does _not_ mean that you will _get the job_; it means that you will _get the right job_ that's suitable for _you_.

# Anatomy of the job application process

</Invert>

---

### The _anatomy_ of a job application process can tell you a lot about the things a company is looking for

---

<Graphviz dot={`digraph A {
  c01 [label="introductionary interview over Skype"]
  c02 [label="signing the contract"]
  c01 -> c02
}`} options={{width: 1200}}/>

<Appear>

Anyone with a good resumé will do ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

</Appear>

---

<Graphviz dot={`digraph A {
  c01 [label="introductionary interview"]
  c02 [label="take-home assignment"]
  c03 [label="assignment evaluation interview"]
  c01 -> c02
  c02 -> c03
}`} options={{width: 1200}}/>

<Appear>

Need a skilled engineer

</Appear>

---

<Graphviz dot={`digraph A {
  c11 [label="introductionary interview with engineering manager"]
  c12 [label="second opinion interview with engineers from different team"]
  c11 -> c12
}`} options={{width: 1200}}/>

<Appear>

A good engineering/cultural fit is important. They'll know it when they see it.

</Appear>

---

<Graphviz dot={`digraph A {
  c21 [label="introductionary interview"]
  c22 [label="online coding test"]
  c23 [label="take-home assignment"]
  c24 [label="assignment evaluation interview"]
  c25 [label="mob programming session with engineers from the team"]
  c26 [label="interview with ceo / cto / division manager"]
  c21 -> c22
  c22 -> c23
  c23 -> c24
  c24 -> c25
  c25 -> c26
}`} options={{width: 1200}}/>

<Appear>

You better be the best of the best and a perfect fit!

</Appear>

---

### Find out what the interview process will be like!

<Appear>

Use that to figure out who they're looking for

...and tweak your strats accordingly.

</Appear>

---

<Invert>

# Mindset

</Invert>

---

## You should know:

<span>Interviewers are looking for someone...
<Appear>
  <span> to fill in a certain <em>role</em>...</span>
  <span> that has the <em>required skills</em>...</span>
  <span> and displays <em>no red flags</em>.</span>
</Appear>
</span>

---

When you _work together_ with your interviewer to _dig up the truth_, interviews will go smoothly.

--- 

### ...so you shouldn't:

<ul>
<Appear>
  <li>Try to "convince" the interviewer(s) that you're the right person</li>
  <li>Assume a different personality</li>
  <li>Present knowledge or skills you don't have</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

---

### ..but please do:

<ul>
<Appear>
  <li>Be honest</li>
  <li>Focus on <em>exposing the truth</em></li>
  <li>Be critical of yourself and the company you're interviewing with</li>
  <li>Be open about your weaknesses</li>
  <li>See the process as a <em>casual conversation</em> to figure out if you could be of use</li>
  <li>Take <em>culture</em> into account</li>
  <li>Be glad that you didn't get the job if you think it was a bad fit</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

# Keys to Success

## Job interviews are like presentations...

---

## Three keys to success

Be:

<ul>
<Appear>
<li>Confident</li>
<li>Comfortable</li>
<li>Enjoying it</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

---


### After an interview, you'll be (implicitly) judged on two qualities:

<Horizontal>

<div style={{paddingRight: "50px"}}>
  <h3>Worthiness</h3>
  <Appear>
    <ul>
      <li>Can you do the job?</li>
      <li>Are you a good cultural fit?</li>
    </ul>
  </Appear>
</div>

<div style={{paddingLeft: "50px"}}>
  <h3>Memorability</h3>
  <Appear>
    <ul>
      <li>Fun</li>
      <li>Unique</li>
      <li>Engaging</li>
    </ul>
  </Appear>
</div>

</Horizontal>

---

## Your skills make you _worthy_

---

## Your personality and personal branding makes you _memorable_

---

<p>Full Stack Software Engineer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

---

<p><strike>Full Stack Software Engineer</strike></p>
<p>Anything as Code evangelist</p>

---

## So ask yourself:

Which skills _do_ you have?

What _is_ the thing that makes you unique?

---

<Invert>

# Interviews: tips and tricks

</Invert>

---

## The best thing about job interviews is that you can _prepare_ for them

---

## You _will_ be asked:

* To introduce yourself
* What your key skills are
* What your key weaknesses are
* To explain why you left your previous job and/or country
* To explain any gaps in your resumé
* ...

---

## For a smooth interview, it's good to come up with - and practice - your introduction.

---

### Example

<Notes>


My name is Joris van de Donk.
Rather than just believing that _infrastructure_ should be expressed as code, I believe that _anything_ should be expressed as code.
I consider myself to be an advocate of this practice, and hope to inspire and teach others to create fun, creative, engaging things with code.
Instead of creating presentations in Powerpoint or Google Slides, I prefer to program them myself using the latest web technologies.
This gives me flexibility, and allows me to create some cool things that otherwise wouldn't be easy to achieve.
I once programmed a presentation about making music using code, and made it so that I could use my electric guitar as a slide clicker. It went really well, despite the fact that I don't really know how to play the guitar, and had to ask the audience how to play certain chords!

This is information dense: it elaborates on how:
* I believe in expressing _anything_ as code, not just _infrastructure_.
* I am enthusiastic about making and holding presentations.
* I am opinionated and back opinions with motivations.
* I am creative and code in my spare time.
* Software engineering ain't just a _job_ to me.
* I like teaching and inspiring others to make cool things.


</Notes>

---

## More tips

* Come prepared; have questions ready! This shows interest.
* Take notes during your conversation.
* If there is a subsequent interview: figure out what you liked about the company, and mention reasons for why you'd think you'll fit in well.

# War Stories

</Invert>

An ancient _United States Military_ proverb:

<Appear>

> Those who don’t have war stories, have not been deployed

</Appear>

---

An ancient _Software Engineer_ proverb:

<Appear>

> Those who don’t have war stories, have not <strike>been</strike> deployed

</Appear>

---

### The act of writing software leads to broken software

---

### By breaking software you learn things

---

### The stories you make along the way could be _entertaining_ and _informative_

---

## Sharing war stories in an interview can be:

* Fun
* Informative
* a way to get people to open up a bit
* a way of signalling values and experience
* an indication of a good cultural fit

---

### They're also _great fun_ at parties/meetups, and thus super easy to practice

# Take-home assignments

</Invert>

---

These are projects that are <em>time-constrained</em> and <em>tightly scoped</em>, so that the interviewers can <em>get an example of the quality of your work</em> and have a <em>reference point to base questions on</em> in a <em>subsequent interview</em>.

<Notes>

maybe elaborate on _why_ companies do these? e.g. they provide lots of info for the company whilst they need to dedicate fairly little time to it

</Notes>

---

## Example

<WrittenText>
  <p>Hi Joris,</p>
  <p>As part of our standard interview procedure, we'd like you to complete a short take-home assignment.</p>
  <p>You should spend no more than 4 hours on this!</p>
  <p>Your task is to create a simple online 2-player web-based Chess game engine. You must separate out the back-end from the front-end. In this chess engine, it must not be possible to make illegal moves.</p>
  <p>Good luck!!</p>
</WrittenText>

---

Tip 1: As soon as you receive a take-home assignment, you should:
* Ask questions
* State assumptions
* State when you will be able to work on it and hand it in

---

<WrittenText>
  <p>Hi Person,</p>
  <p>Would it be okay if I <b>write this in TypeScript?</b></p>
  <p>I'm going to <b>assume</b> that the reviewer of my project will be working on an environment <em>in which they can</em> <b>run and build Docker containers</b>.</p>
  <p>I will be working on this during the weekend, and hope to <b>send you the finished project before the end of Sunday</b>.</p>
  <p>Regards, Joris</p>
</WrittenText>

---

Tip 2: You should treat these projects like any other small project you work on !

---


The first thing you do?

<Appear>
  

  <div>
    <code>
    git init
    </code>
  </div>


</Appear>

---

Then:

<Gitgraph options={{orientation: 'vertical-reverse', template: templateExtend(props.templateName || TemplateName.Metro, {
  commit: {
    message: { displayHash: false, displayAuthor: false },
  },
})}}>
  {(gitgraph) => {
    const master = gitgraph.branch("master");
    master.commit("Initial empty commit. Let's do this!");
    master.commit("Scaffold project, add required dependencies");
    master.commit("Add unit testing framework");
    master.commit("Added readme with instructions on how to boot up the project");
    master.commit("Make booting up project easier with docker-compose");
    master.commit("First functionality! Can now see a chess board! 🎉")
    master.commit("Implemented pawns ♟️");
    master.commit("Switch from Parcel to Webpack");
    master.commit("..");
    master.commit("Clarified which OS the project was developed and tested on in readme");
    master.tag("v1.0.0");
  }}
</Gitgraph>


---

## Finally, do a retro & lookahead!

<ul>
  <Appear>
  <li>What went well?</li>
  <li>What went wrong?</li>
  <li>What would you do differently next time?</li>
  <li>What would you add to the project if you <em>had more time</em> or <em>wanted to expand on the project</em>?</li>
  <b>Write all of this up in your readme file!</b>
</Appear>
</ul>

---

## More tips

<ul>
<Appear>
  <li>Hand in your entire git repo! Mention that you have included the entire repo when handing it in.</li>
  <li>Your git commits can influence and steer the conversation.</li>
  <li>A good readme matters <b>a lot</b>. Spend time on it!</li>
  <li>The easier a project is to get running, the better it is!</li>
  <li>Write foolproof instructions; don't assume someone knows how <inlineCode>npm</inlineCode> works.</li>
  <li>Mention if you got external help (e.g. from a friend/colleague) or spent more than the allotted amount of time on it.</li>
</Appear>
</ul>
